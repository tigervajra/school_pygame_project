Oh, hey you! Freshly installed, huh?
...
I'm Lil' Helper.exe... hmm, what am I doing here?
.....
Well, I’m here to help lost packets like you!
It’s literally in the name.
Anyhow, stick with me now, I know all the shortcuts around here.
Although, this system’s a bit... buggy,
imma need your help decrypting it.
