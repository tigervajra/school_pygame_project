The Dao that can be spoken of is not the ever-constant Dao.
The name that can be named is not the ever-constant name.
That which is without-name is the beginning of heaven and earth.
That which possesses a name is the mother of the ten thousand creatures.
Therefore : always without-desire, thus you observe its subtle mystery.
Always possessing desires, thus you observe its external appearances.
These two, they arise from the same source but have different names;
This sameness is called their deep mystery.
Deep mysteries, and again deep mysteries â€“
The gateway of many subtle mysteries.
